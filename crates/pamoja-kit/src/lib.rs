#![cfg_attr(not(test), no_std)]

//! Goal-named helper math for the pamoja SDK.
//!
//! The hardest part of building something real on a cheap sensor is rarely reading
//! the sensor; it is turning that reading into a decision that holds up in the
//! field. `pamoja-kit` is the layer that closes that gap for people who are not
//! signal-processing engineers. Each helper is named for the goal rather than the
//! technique, ships with correct defaults, and documents the real algorithm one
//! layer down, so it teaches as it abstracts.
//!
//! The first helpers cover the jobs the cookbook leans on most:
//!
//! - [`Smoother`] - smooth a noisy reading (exponential moving average).
//! - [`Calibration`] - turn a raw reading into real units (two-point linear map).
//! - [`Thermostat`] - keep a reading near a setpoint (on/off control with
//!   hysteresis).
//! - [`Depletion`] - warn before a falling level runs out (linear extrapolation).
//!
//! The crate is `no_std` and allocation-free, so the same helpers run on a
//! microcontroller and on a server.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! Compose two helpers to hold a noisy fridge probe near 4 C:
//!
//! ```
//! use pamoja_kit::{Smoother, Thermostat};
//!
//! let mut probe = Smoother::new(0.5);
//! let mut fridge = Thermostat::cooling(4.0, 0.5);
//!
//! // A warm, noisy reading is smoothed, then drives the cooler on.
//! let cooler_on = fridge.update(probe.update(7.8));
//! assert!(cooler_on);
//! ```
