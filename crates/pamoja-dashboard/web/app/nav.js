// nav.js - overlay navigation via zQuery router substates.
//
// Every overlay (modals, drawers, the network view and its docked panels) opens with
// open() and closes with back(). Opening pushes a sub-route history entry; the browser
// Back button and Escape both unwind the stack in LIFO order, closing the topmost
// overlay first. History is the single source of truth, so a sensor opened from the
// network backs out to the network, and one opened from the grid backs out to the grid.
//
// zQuery fires onSubstate on a back-pop with action 'pop' (when another substate is now
// current) or 'reset'/null (when the last substate was left). We close the topmost
// overlay on ANY such pop and return true to consume it, so the route is never
// re-resolved underneath the overlay. See zQuery docs: Router > Sub-Route Substates.
