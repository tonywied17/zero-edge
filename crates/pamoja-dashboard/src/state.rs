//! The language-neutral fleet snapshot a gateway serves to its dashboard.

//! A dashboard often watches more than one node: a clinic with several cold-chain

//! holding its own sensors. Everything human-facing travels as stable keys, stable
//! codes, raw values, and canonical units, identical in every locale; the page renders
//! the words and the formatting at the surface.
