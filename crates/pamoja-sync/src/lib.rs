//! Offline-first store-and-forward buffering for pamoja.
//!
//! Devices on intermittent links append records while offline and drain them in
//! order when a link returns, so a node that is disconnected for hours or days
//! loses nothing. This crate provides durable first-in first-out implementations
//! of the core [`Store`](pamoja_core::Store) trait:
//!
//! - [`MemoryStore`] - a fast in-memory queue, optionally capacity-bounded so a
//!   full queue becomes an explicit backpressure signal.
//! - [`FileStore`] - a crash-safe on-disk queue that survives power loss, for the
//!   power-loss-safe field logging the mission depends on.
//!
//! Both buffer raw bytes, so an application pairs a [`Store`](pamoja_core::Store)
//! with a [`Codec`](https://docs.rs/pamoja-codec) to persist encoded payloads and
//! a [`Transport`](pamoja_core::Transport) to forward them when a link appears.
