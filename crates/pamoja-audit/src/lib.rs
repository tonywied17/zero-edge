#![cfg_attr(not(test), no_std)]

//! Tamper-evident audit logs for the pamoja SDK.
//!
//! The health and cold-chain deployments this SDK targets need more than authentic
//! readings; they need an authentic *record* of them. A vaccine fridge's
//! temperature history is only useful as evidence if no one can quietly edit out an
//! excursion, drop an inconvenient reading, or reorder the log after the fact. This
//! crate provides that record by chaining signed entries together:
//!
//! - [`AuditLog`] - appends entries, each signed with a
//!   [`DeviceIdentity`](pamoja_security::DeviceIdentity) and linked by hash to the
//!   entry before it.
//! - [`Entry`] - one record: its payload, its index, the previous entry's digest,
//!   and the signature, with a byte form for durable storage.
//! - [`Verifier`] and [`verify_chain`] - replay a stored log and confirm, against the
//!   device's [`PublicIdentity`](pamoja_security::PublicIdentity), that every entry
//!   is in sequence, correctly chained, and authentically signed.
//!
//! Because each entry commits to the previous one with a SHA-256 hash and an ed25519
//! signature, altering a payload, reordering entries, inserting a forgery, or
//! dropping a record all break verification at the point of tampering. The crate is
//! `no_std` and synchronous, so the same log can be written on a microcontroller and
//! audited on a server.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! ```
//! use pamoja_audit::{verify_chain, AuditLog, Entry};
//! use pamoja_security::DeviceIdentity;
//!
//! let device = DeviceIdentity::from_seed(&[9u8; 32]);
//! let public = device.public();
//!
//! // Record two readings, persisting each entry's bytes as you would to an SD card.
//! let mut log = AuditLog::new(device);
//! let mut stored: Vec<Vec<u8>> = Vec::new();
//! for reading in [b"4.6C".as_slice(), b"4.9C".as_slice()] {
//!     stored.push(log.append(reading).to_bytes());
//! }
//!
//! // An auditor rebuilds the chain from storage and verifies it.
//! let entries: Vec<Entry> = stored
//!     .iter()
//!     .map(|bytes| Entry::from_bytes(bytes))
//!     .collect::<pamoja_core::Result<_>>()
//!     .unwrap();
//! assert!(verify_chain(&public, &entries).is_ok());
//! ```
