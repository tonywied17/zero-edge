//! An in-memory typed publish/subscribe event bus.
//!
//! [`BroadcastBus`] implements the core [`EventBus`](pamoja_core::EventBus) trait
//! over a bounded broadcast channel: every event published is delivered to every
//! current subscriber. Producers such as sensors and transports publish events,
//! and consumers await them, all statically typed to one event type per bus.
//!
//! The bus is bounded, so a subscriber that falls far enough behind drops the
//! events it missed and resumes from the most recent ones. This keeps a slow
//! consumer from holding memory without bound, which matters on constrained
//! devices.

use tokio::sync::broadcast;

/// A typed publish/subscribe bus that broadcasts each event to all subscribers.
///
/// Every handle can both publish and receive. Use [`subscribe`](BroadcastBus::subscribe)
/// to add an independent consumer; an event published after a handle subscribes
/// is delivered to it. A subscriber only sees events published after it
/// subscribed, mirroring a live pub/sub channel.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// use pamoja_core::EventBus;
/// use pamoja_bus::BroadcastBus;
///
/// # async fn run() -> pamoja_core::Result<()> {
/// let bus = BroadcastBus::new(16);
/// let mut subscriber = bus.subscribe();
/// bus.publish("reading").await?;
/// assert_eq!(subscriber.next_event().await?, Some("reading"));
/// # Ok(())
/// # }
