#![cfg_attr(not(test), no_std)]

//! On-board bus addressing and pin logic for the pamoja SDK.
//!
//! Before a node reaches any network it has to talk to the chips wired to the board it
//! sits on. Three interfaces cover almost everything cheap hardware uses: I2C for the
//! dense breakout sensors (a BME280, an INA226, an MPU9250, an SSD1306 screen), SPI for
//! displays, SD cards, and LoRa radios, and plain GPIO pins for the relays, valves,
//! buttons, and motion sensors that switch a single line. Each carries a small, exact
//! piece of logic that is pure arithmetic with no hardware attached, and getting it wrong
//! is a classic field bug: the wrong I2C address byte, the wrong SPI clock mode, or an
//! active-low relay driven as if it were active-high.
//!
//! This crate is that logic, with no pins toggled and no allocation:
//!
//! - [`i2c`] - I2C addressing per the NXP I2C-bus specification (UM10204): the 7-bit
//!   address byte `(address << 1) | r/w`, the two-byte `11110xx` frame for a 10-bit
//!   address, and the reserved ranges (`0x00..=0x07` and `0x78..=0x7F`) that leave
//!   `0x08..=0x77` for real devices, so a bad address is caught before it reaches the bus.
//! - [`spi`] - the four SPI clock [`Mode`](spi::Mode)s as the `(CPOL, CPHA)` pair every
//!   datasheet quotes, plus bit order, so "mode 3, MSB first" is a checked value rather
//!   than two booleans a caller can transpose.
//! - [`pin`] - the GPIO pin model: physical [`Level`](pin::Level), input pull and output
//!   drive, the interrupt [`Edge`](pin::Edge), and an active-high/active-low
//!   [`Polarity`](pin::Polarity) that maps a logical "asserted" onto the physical level,
//!   so an active-low button or relay is handled by the type rather than by remembering
//!   to invert.
//!
//! Everything is exact integer work over `Copy` values, so the same logic runs on the
//! smallest microcontroller driving the bus. Clocking the bytes and toggling the lines
//! themselves arrives with the hardware-I/O layer; this is the addressing-and-mode half
//! ahead of it.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! ```
//! use pamoja_gpio::i2c::{Address, Direction};
//! use pamoja_gpio::pin::{Level, Polarity};
//! use pamoja_gpio::spi::Mode;
//!
//! // A DS3231 real-time clock answers at 7-bit address 0x68; its read frame is one byte.
//! let rtc = Address::seven_bit(0x68)?;
//! let mut frame = [0u8; 2];
//! let n = rtc.write_frame(Direction::Read, &mut frame)?;
//! assert_eq!(&frame[..n], &[0xD1]); // (0x68 << 1) | 1
//!
//! // SPI clock mode 0 is the (CPOL, CPHA) pair (false, false), as a datasheet quotes it.
//! assert_eq!(Mode::Mode0.cpol_cpha(), (false, false));
//!
//! // An active-low relay is energised by driving its pin low.
//! assert_eq!(Polarity::ActiveLow.level(true), Level::Low);
//! # Ok::<(), pamoja_gpio::GpioError>(())
//! ```
