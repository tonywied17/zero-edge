//! I2C device addressing per the NXP I2C-bus specification (UM10204).
//!
//! An I2C transfer begins with the controller sending the device's address. The exact
//! bytes are pinned down by the specification, and they are easy to get subtly wrong: the
//! 7-bit address shares its byte with the read/write bit, so the value a datasheet prints
//! is not the byte that goes on the wire, and the 10-bit extension spends a reserved
//! prefix and spreads its bits across two bytes. This module builds those bytes exactly
//! and rejects an address that is out of range or, on request, one the specification
//! reserves.
