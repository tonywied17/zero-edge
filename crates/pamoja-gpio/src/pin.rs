//! The GPIO pin model: levels, pull and drive configuration, interrupt edges, and active
//! polarity.
//!
//! A GPIO pin is the simplest interface on a board: one line that is either high or low.
//! The logic that still has to be right is the meaning of that level. A button wired to
//! ground through a pull-up reads low when pressed; a relay board sold as "active low"
//! switches on when its input is driven low. Treating "pressed" or "on" as if it always
//! meant a high level is a classic inversion bug. This module carries the small set of
//! GPIO concepts so that mapping is written down once rather than scattered through call
//! sites.
