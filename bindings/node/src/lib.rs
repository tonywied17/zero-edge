//! Node.js bindings for the zero-edge SDK, generated with napi-rs.
//!
//! This crate is the generated low-level surface (the contract tier): it exposes
//! the Rust core and capability crates to JavaScript and TypeScript one-to-one. A
//! hand-written, idiomatic facade wraps it for everyday use; see the package's
//! TypeScript entry point.
