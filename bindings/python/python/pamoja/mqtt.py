"""Idiomatic async MQTT client facade.

Wraps the native :class:`pamoja._core.MqttClient` with a Python-native surface:
awaitable methods, ``async for`` iteration over messages, ``async with``
lifecycle management, a string enum for quality of service, and keyword
construction. It adds ergonomics only; every operation delegates to the Rust
core.
