## In plain words

pamoja is free software for building things that watch and control the physical world - a
fridge that warns you before vaccines spoil, a pump that runs when a tank gets low, a sensor
that keeps working when the internet does not. It is built to run on cheap, solar-powered
hardware and the ordinary phones people already have, in places with little money and weak or
no connectivity. It costs nothing and works offline.

You do not have to be an engineer to use it, and you do not give anything up if you are one.

**Where to start**

- **Try it with no hardware.** The simulators (`pamoja-sim`) stand in for real sensors, radios, and even a robot, so you can build and test with nothing plugged in.
- **Building something?** Skip to [A quick look](#a-quick-look) and the [crate list](#engine-and-capability-crates), and add only the pieces you need.
- **On a microcontroller or in a rural clinic?** That is the design target, not an afterthought - see [Why it exists](#why-it-exists).

## What is pamoja

pamoja is a single, modular SDK for IoT, robotics, and drones: one memory-safe Rust engine at the core, with idiomatic bindings for the languages a device developer actually uses. You install only the capabilities you need, and the same concepts work the same way in every language.

Control and communicate with physical things - sensors, robots, drones, gateways - from TypeScript, Python, C#, Lua, or Rust itself, with C-class performance and memory safety, without hand-rolling FFI.

## Why it exists

The places where connected devices can do the most good - smallholder farms, off-grid villages, rural clinics, disaster zones - are exactly the places with the least money, the worst connectivity, and the cheapest hardware. Most IoT and robotics stacks quietly assume the opposite of all of that.

pamoja is built for the hard environment first. If it runs well on a two-dollar microcontroller on a solar panel with an intermittent radio link, it runs well anywhere. That single constraint makes the library better for everyone.

What that means in practice:

- Cheap and salvageable hardware, down to microcontrollers with a few hundred KB of RAM.
- Offline-first: local buffering and store-and-forward, so a device disconnected for days loses nothing.
- Low bandwidth and long range: compact codecs and radio (LoRa, mesh) treated as first-class.
- Low power: async duty-cycling and energy-aware scheduling for battery and solar.
- Free and unencumbered, so cost is never a barrier to use.
- Reachable: many languages, plus a plain-language helper layer so you do not need to be an engineer to build something that works.

## The pillars

- Performant - native Rust, async-first, small enough to run `no_std` on microcontrollers.
- Secure - memory safety by construction, TLS 1.3 / DTLS, device identity, signed OTA.
- Quality of life - one consistent API in every language, with a high-level ergonomic facade plus a low-level escape hatch.
- Easy to adopt - opt-in scoped packages, strong defaults, and simulators so you can build and test with zero hardware.

## Status

The engine and capability crates and the language bindings below are available
today.

### Engine and capability crates

| Crate | Area | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`pamoja-core`](docs/pamoja-core/README.md) | core | The device model: `Transport`, `Device`, `Sensor`, `Actuator`, `Store`, event-bus, and error traits. |
| [`pamoja-codec`](docs/pamoja-codec/README.md) | serialize | CBOR, JSON, and raw codecs behind one trait, plus delta+varint batch packing and an `f32` quantizer for metered links. |
| [`pamoja-mqtt`](docs/pamoja-mqtt/README.md) | messaging | An MQTT client implementing the core `Transport` trait, tested against an embedded broker. |
| [`pamoja-coap`](docs/pamoja-coap/README.md) | messaging | A CoAP client over UDP with confirmable and non-confirmable delivery and RFC 7641 observe. |
| [`pamoja-ladder`](docs/pamoja-ladder/README.md) | resilience | A cost-aware transport ladder: cheapest reachable rung first, buffering to a `Store` when every link is down. |
| [`pamoja-sync`](docs/pamoja-sync/README.md) | resilience | Offline-first store-and-forward queues: in-memory, plus a crash-safe on-disk queue that survives power loss. |
| [`pamoja-dashboard`](docs/pamoja-dashboard/README.md) | resilience | A local-first fleet dashboard a node serves over its own hotspot - multilingual and fully offline, with a hardware-free mock for development - so a community can see its own data with no cloud. |
| [`pamoja-bus`](docs/pamoja-bus/README.md) | core | An in-memory typed publish/subscribe event bus implementing the core `EventBus` trait. |
| [`pamoja-loopback`](docs/pamoja-loopback/README.md) | testing | An in-process `Transport` with topic matching and a fault injector, exercising the full path with no broker. |
| [`pamoja-sim`](docs/pamoja-sim/README.md) | testing | Hardware-free simulators: noisy and replay sensors, a recording actuator, a degraded-link transport, and a simulated robot that turns velocity commands into a dead-reckoned pose. |
| [`pamoja-power`](docs/pamoja-power/README.md) | energy | Duty cycling plus an energy-aware governor that stretches work as the battery drains and eases off while charging. |
| [`pamoja-security`](docs/pamoja-security/README.md) | trust | ed25519 device identity: sign a device's telemetry and verify it, so a gateway can prove a reading is authentic. |
| [`pamoja-audit`](docs/pamoja-audit/README.md) | trust | A `no_std` tamper-evident, SHA-256 hash-chained log; altering, reordering, or dropping any record breaks verification. |
| [`pamoja-session`](docs/pamoja-session/README.md) | trust | A secured channel - X25519 key agreement, HKDF, and ChaCha20-Poly1305 with an anti-replay window - so two nodes get confidentiality and integrity over a hostile link without a TLS stack. |
| [`pamoja-telemetry`](docs/pamoja-telemetry/README.md) | observe | Allocation-free observability that ships only what is worth the bytes as link cost rises, while counting everything. |
| [`pamoja-lora`](docs/pamoja-lora/README.md) | radio | The exact LoRa time-on-air of a payload and the duty-cycle off-time it forces, so a node stays in regulation and budget. |
| [`pamoja-lorawan`](docs/pamoja-lorawan/README.md) | radio | LoRaWAN 1.0.x MAC framing with AES-CMAC and AES encryption and OTAA join, against the FIPS-197 and RFC 4493 vectors. |
| [`pamoja-mesh`](docs/pamoja-mesh/README.md) | mesh | Addressed, hop-limited, CRC-checked frames plus duplicate suppression that floods a packet across the mesh exactly once. |
| [`pamoja-routing`](docs/pamoja-routing/README.md) | mesh | Reverse-path routing that learns the cheapest route from overheard traffic, saving the airtime flooding wastes. |
| [`pamoja-modbus`](docs/pamoja-modbus/README.md) | field I/O | Modbus RTU framing (CRC-16/Modbus) with request builders and reply decoders for RS485 field sensors. |
| [`pamoja-can`](docs/pamoja-can/README.md) | field I/O | CAN 2.0 and CAN-FD frames (11- and 29-bit IDs) plus J1939 decode and compose for trucks, tractors, and gensets. |
| [`pamoja-serial`](docs/pamoja-serial/README.md) | field I/O | SLIP (RFC 1055) and COBS byte-stuffing with streaming frame decoders, so a raw UART byte stream carries discrete packets to motor controllers, GPS, and LiDAR. |
| [`pamoja-gpio`](docs/pamoja-gpio/README.md) | field I/O | On-board bus logic: I2C 7- and 10-bit address frames (NXP UM10204) with reserved-range checks, the four SPI clock modes, and active-high/active-low GPIO pins. |
| [`pamoja-sensors`](docs/pamoja-sensors/README.md) | field I/O | Datasheet-anchored, `no_std` decoders for common, cheap parts: BME280 (temp/humidity/pressure), DS18B20, INA219 power, and the ADS1115 ADC. |
| [`pamoja-actuators`](docs/pamoja-actuators/README.md) | field I/O | `no_std` drivers for cheap outputs: PCA9685 16-channel PWM with servo-angle helpers, plus a stepper driver. |
| [`pamoja-zenoh`](docs/pamoja-zenoh/README.md) | robotics | A Zenoh transport plus a key-expression engine (validity, canonical form, wildcard matching) so fleets and robots share data over Zenoh, with or without ROS 2. |
| [`pamoja-ros2`](docs/pamoja-ros2/README.md) | robotics | A ROS 2 bridge - topics, services, and actions - with ROS 2 name, RIHS01 type-hash, and CDR handling plus rmw_zenoh key assembly, so a robot appears as an ordinary pamoja device; interoperates with rmw_zenoh, routerless. |
| [`pamoja-kit`](docs/pamoja-kit/README.md) | ergonomics | Plain-language helpers that name the goal over the math: smoothing/filtering (EMA, median, Kalman, complementary, debounce), calibration, units and deadband shaping, PID and on/off control with ramping, trend/surge/depletion and anomaly prediction, rolling-window stats, wheel kinematics (differential, Ackermann, skid-steer, mecanum), odometry, waypoint guidance and motion safety (e-stop, watchdog, limits), two-link arm forward/inverse kinematics, and geo (distance/bearing/geofence), IMU tilt, and dew-point helpers. |
| [`pamoja-profile`](docs/pamoja-profile/README.md) | ergonomics | Named, ready-to-run device profiles from plain data or a JSON manifest; assembled and testable with no hardware. |
| [`pamoja-ffi`](docs/pamoja-ffi/README.md) | bindings | The curated C ABI over the core and MQTT, with a `cbindgen`-generated, drift-checked `pamoja.h`. |

### Language bindings

| Package | Language | What it is |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `@pamoja/core` | TypeScript / Node | A generated contract plus a hand-written TypeScript facade (napi-rs). |
| `pamoja-core` | Python | A generated, type-stubbed contract plus a hand-written async facade (PyO3 + maturin). |
| `Pamoja.Core` | C# / .NET | A P/Invoke interop layer plus an async facade with `IAsyncEnumerable` streams and `IAsyncDisposable` lifecycle. |

CI runs formatting, clippy, and tests for the workspace, builds the Node, Python, and .NET bindings, and fails if any generated surface (the binding contracts and the C header) drifts from the Rust source. Release workflows publish to crates.io, npm, PyPI, and NuGet on a version tag. Everything past this is on the roadmap below.

## A quick look

TypeScript, through the ergonomic facade:

```ts
import { MqttClient } from '@pamoja/core'

const client = new MqttClient({ clientId: 'sensor-1', host: 'localhost', port: 1883 })
await client.connect()
await client.subscribe('sensors/+/temperature')
await client.publish('sensors/1/temperature', '21.5')

for await (const message of client) {
  console.log(message.topic, message.payload.toString())
}
```

The same shape in Python, through its async facade:

```python
import asyncio
from pamoja import MqttClient

async def main():
    async with MqttClient(client_id="sensor-1", host="localhost", port=1883) as client:
        await client.subscribe("sensors/+/temperature")
        await client.publish("sensors/1/temperature", "21.5")
        async for message in client:
            print(message.topic, message.payload.decode())

asyncio.run(main())
```

The same shape in C#, through its async facade:

```csharp
using Pamoja.Core;

await using var client = new MqttClient(new MqttClientOptions
{
    ClientId = "sensor-1",
    Host = "localhost",
    Port = 1883,
});
await client.ConnectAsync();
await client.SubscribeAsync("sensors/+/temperature");
await client.PublishAsync("sensors/1/temperature", "21.5");

await foreach (var message in client)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"{message.Topic}: {message.Payload.Length} bytes");
}
```

The same thing in Rust:

```rust
use pamoja_core::Transport;
use pamoja_mqtt::{MqttConfig, MqttTransport};

let mut transport = MqttTransport::new(MqttConfig::new("sensor-1", "localhost", 1883));
transport.connect().await?;
transport.subscribe("sensors/+/temperature").await?;
transport.send("sensors/1/temperature", b"21.5").await?;
```

## Architecture

Every domain capability is a separate crate behind a trait defined in the core. The core knows about `Transport`, `Device`, `Sensor`, `Actuator`, `Store`, and the event bus; it knows nothing about MQTT or CAN specifically. Concrete crates implement those traits and are pulled in only when needed, so nobody pays for what they do not use, and on a microcontroller you compile in two crates and nothing else.

This separation is literal in Rust: `pamoja-core` defines the traits, and each transport (`pamoja-mqtt`, `pamoja-coap`) is its own crate. That is why the Rust example above pulls `MqttTransport` from `pamoja-mqtt`, not from the core. The language bindings are heading to the same shape, with capability-scoped packages (`@pamoja/mqtt`, `pamoja-mqtt`, `Pamoja.Mqtt`) sitting next to the core package. Today, while the polyglot release pipeline is being proven end to end with a single capability, that first transport ships inside each language's `core` package, which is why the TypeScript, Python, and C# examples above import `MqttClient` from it. Splitting the bindings into scoped packages is on the roadmap.

## Roadmap

Messaging and radio. MQTT and CoAP work today, behind a cost-aware transport ladder that tries the cheapest link first and buffers when there is none. LoRa and LoRaWAN long-range radio, and a CRC-checked mesh frame with reverse-path routing, now ship as further rungs. Next: the cheap-radio drivers they ride on (ESP-NOW, nRF24), a Meshtastic bridge for off-grid networks, and cellular and satellite uplinks for the most remote telemetry.

Hardware and sensors. Serial (SLIP/COBS), CAN with J1939, RS485/Modbus, and on-board GPIO/I2C/SPI ship today for field wiring, alongside datasheet-anchored decoders for common, salvageable parts (BME280, DS18B20, INA219, ADS1115) and actuator drivers (PCA9685 PWM/servo, stepper). You can also instantiate a node by name with a device profile (an irrigation node, a well-level monitor) instead of wiring pins. Next: a broader driver catalog.

Resilience and power. Offline-first store-and-forward, energy-aware duty cycling for solar and battery, and a local-first dashboard a node serves over its own hotspot - multilingual, fully offline, with a hardware-free mock - all work today; next is data-mule sync for places with no link at all.

Robotics and drones. A ROS 2 bridge - topics, services, and actions - over a Zenoh transport ships today, interoperating with rmw_zenoh, routerless; the kit adds wheel kinematics, odometry, waypoint guidance, motion safety, and arm forward/inverse kinematics, and a simulated robot exercises it all with no hardware. MAVLink for drones is next, modeled as ordinary pamoja devices.

Security. Memory safety by construction today, with ed25519 device identity, a tamper-evident hash-chained audit log, and a secured channel (X25519 key agreement and ChaCha20-Poly1305 with anti-replay) already shipping. Next: TLS 1.3 and DTLS, X.509 device identity, and signed OTA updates with verified rollback.

Reach. Bindings beyond Node: Python, C#/.NET, Lua, WebAssembly, Kotlin, Swift, and Go. The plain-language helper layer (`pamoja-kit`) is broad today - smooth a noisy reading, hold a value with a PID, warn before a tank runs dry, steer by wheel kinematics - each naming the goal over the math with the real algorithm one layer down. And an offline-first community cookbook so the SDK reaches the people it is built for.

cargo test --workspace       # run tests, including doctests and the MQTT round-trip

cd bindings/node
npm install && npm run build  # build the native addon and the TypeScript facade
npm test                      # smoke-test the binding

cd ../python
python -m venv .venv && . .venv/bin/activate
pip install maturin pytest && maturin develop  # build the extension and install the facade
pytest                                          # smoke-test the binding

cd ../..
cargo build -p pamoja-ffi --release                       # build the native C ABI and refresh pamoja.h
dotnet build bindings/dotnet/Pamoja.Core.sln -c Release    # build the .NET interop and facade
dotnet run --project bindings/dotnet/tests/Pamoja.Core.Smoke -c Release  # smoke-test the binding
```

The local toolchain needs no extra components; formatting and clippy run in CI.
