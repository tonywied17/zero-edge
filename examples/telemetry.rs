//! Observability that degrades gracefully on a metered link.
//!
//! A node reports structured events at different severities. While the link is free
//! it ships everything; as the link becomes metered and then expensive, the reporter
//! raises its bar so only the events worth their bytes go out, while still counting
//! the rest so the aggregate picture stays complete. At the end it ships a compact,
//! delta-encoded snapshot of the counters instead of the raw event stream. Composes
//! `pamoja-telemetry` and `pamoja-codec`, with no hardware.
//!
//! Run with: `cargo run -p pamoja-examples --example telemetry`
