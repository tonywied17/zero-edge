//! Offline-first store-and-forward, end to end, with no hardware and no broker.
//!
//! A field sensor encodes its readings with CBOR and buffers them in a durable
//! queue while it has no link. When a link appears, it forwards everything
//! buffered over an in-process loopback transport to a gateway, which decodes and
//! prints each reading. This composes four crates - `pamoja-codec`, `pamoja-sync`,
//! `pamoja-loopback`, and the core traits - through the same shapes every binding
//! exposes.
//!
//! Run with: `cargo run -p pamoja-examples --example store_and_forward`
