//! A cold-chain fridge node and its gateway, run end to end over loopback.
//!
//! This is the SDK's conformance scenario: one run that threads a reading through every
//! layer a real cold-chain deployment uses, so the crates are proven to compose rather
//! than only to work in isolation. A simulated probe warms past its safe range; each
//! reading is judged by the device profile, encoded by the codec, signed and chained
//! into a tamper-evident log, accounted for by the metered-link telemetry, and published
//! over the in-process loopback link to a gateway that verifies and decodes it. The run
//! returns everything it observed, so a test can assert each seam held and an example can
//! narrate the story.
//!
//! It composes `pamoja-sim`, `pamoja-profile`, `pamoja-codec`, `pamoja-security`,
//! `pamoja-audit`, `pamoja-telemetry`, and `pamoja-loopback` over `pamoja-core`, with no
//! hardware and no broker.
